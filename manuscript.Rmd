# Abstract

Background: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) varies significantly across ethnic groups. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the variation in different ethnic groups may help to elucidate the pathophysiology of T2DM. The present work aims to generate a hypothesis regarding "why do subjects with African background have excess burden of T2DM?".

Methods: In the current study, we performed metabolite profiling of plasma samples derived from 773 subjects of three ethnic groups (Dutch with European, Ghanaian and African Surinamese background). We performed Bayesian lognormal regression analyses between HbA1c and circulating metabolites. 

Results: We showed that subjects with Ghanaian and African Surinamese background had similar associations of HbA1c with circulating amino acids as subjects with European background. But subjects with Ghanaian and African Surinamese background had reversed association between HbA1c and acetoacetate, compared to the subjects with European background. Moreover, we also observed that HbA1c was associated with small HDL particles in subjects with African Surinamese background. 

Conclusions: Based on the observations, we hypothesize that subjects with African background may have impaired cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL, linking to their excess burden of T2DM.

# Introduction

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased rapidly worldwide during the past decades, and is strongly associated with the developing obesity pandemic [@NCD-Risk-Factor-Collaboration-NCD-RisC:2016aa]. Apart from the common risk factors that prevail in all populations, ethnic background is a risk factor as well [@Maskarinec:2009aa]. In the Netherlands, subjects with a migration background showed a considerable higher incidence of T2DM compared to subjects with European background [@Bindraban:2008aa; @Ujcic-Voortman:2009aa]. Among men, individuals with European, Ghanaian and African Surinamese background had T2DM prevalence of 5.0%, 14.9% and 10.4%, respectively [@Meeks:2015aa]. Among women, the prevalence is 2.3% (European), 11.1% (Ghanaian) and 11.5% (African Surinamese) [@Meeks:2015aa]. The differences in T2DM prevalence across ethnic groups could not be explained by genetic variants alone [@Waters:2010aa]. In contrast, other studies showed that the ethnic differences in T2DM prevalence were accompanied by differences in plasma amino acids and lipids. In line with this, compared to Europeans, the serum concentrations of isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and alanine were significantly higher in South Asians [@Tillin:2015aa]. In another study [@Valkengoed:2017aa], individuals with Surinamese background were identified to have lower sphingolipids, but higher unsaturated acylcarnitines and higher amino acid levels, than Europeans. 

Metabolite profiling, or metabolomics, has been widely applied to identify new biomarkers for T2DM [@Roberts:2014aa; @Guasch-Ferre:2016aa], predict T2DM risk [@Wang:2011aa; @Rebholz:2018aa] and improve our understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms [@Newgard:2009aa; @Newgard:2017aa]. The most frequently observed metabolic abnormalities in insulin resistant and T2DM subjects include elevated circulating branched amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs) [@Wurtz:2012ab; @Wurtz:2012aa; @Wurtz:2013aa]. A hypothesized mechanism linking elevated BCAAs to T2DM is that disturbed BCAA metabolism leads to accumulation of BCAA metabolites (e.g. 2-Aminoadipic acid), resulting in pancreatic $\beta$ cell dysfunction [@Lynch:2014aa; @Wang:2013aa]. High triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol is another frequently observed metabolic abnormality in insulin resistance and T2DM subjects [@Fizelova:2015aa; @Festa:2005aa; @Mackey:2015aa; @Wang:2012aa; @Garvey:2003aa]. Often dyslipidemias are viewed as consequences rather than cause of T2DM [@Fizelova:2015aa; @Festa:2005aa; @Mackey:2015aa]. However, cholesterol homeostasis plays an important role in regulating pancreatic $\beta$ cell function [@Eckardstein:2011aa; @Fryirs:2010aa; @Kruit:2011aa]. Cholesterol is taken up by pancreatic $\beta$ cells via the LDL receptor and exported back to plasma via the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) [@Kruit:2010aa]. Accumulation of cholesterol in pancreatic $\beta$ cells leads to impairment of glucose tolerance and defective insulin secretion [@Kruit:2010aa; @Eckardstein:2011aa; @Kruit:2011aa]. 

The present work aimed to generate a hypothesis regarding "why do subjects with African background have excess burden of T2DM?". As an initial step, we investigated whether the relationship between circulating metabolites and glucose tolerance varies depending on ethnicity. The current study focused on Dutch with European, Ghanaian and African Surinamese background. Here we used the hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) level as the surrogate of glucose tolerance, since HbA1c is an index of chronic glycemia and a predictor of T2DM [@Nathan:1984aa; @Diabetes-Prevention-Program-Research-Group:2015aa]. By running Bayesian lognormal regression analyses, we show that compared to the European origin, Dutch with Ghanaian and African Surinamese background have similar associations of HbA1c with circulating amino acids, but reversed association between HbA1c and concentration of acetoacetate. We also observed that HbA1c was associated with small HDL particles in subjects with African Surinamese background. We hypothesized that subjects with African background may have impaired cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL, linking to their excess burden of T2DM. 

# Materials and Methods

## Study population

The study was composed of three ethnic groups in the Dutch population. In particular, 217 African Surinamese and 255 Ghanaian were from the HELIUS study [@Stronks:2013aa; @Snijder:2017aa], and 301 European Dutch were from the 300-obesity cohort from the Human Functional Genomics Project [@Netea:2016aa]. The HELIUS study was complied with all relevant ethical regulations and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (6th, 7th revisions); it was approved by the Academic Medical Center (AMC) Medical Ethics Committee and all participants provided written informed consent.

## Metabolite profiling

Fasting plasma samples were collected in the clinic and stored at $-80^\circ$C. Quantification of 8 amino acids, 2 ketone bodies and 14 lipoproteins was performed by using a high-throughput NMR metabolomics platform (Nightingale, Austria) [@Inouye:2010aa]. The following 14 lipoprotein subclasses were quantified: extremely large (average particle diameter >75 nm), very large (average particle diameter 64.0 nm), large (53.6 nm), medium (44.5 nm), small (36.8 nm) and very small VLDL (31.3 nm). intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL; 28.6 nm); three LDL subclasses, i.e. large (25.5 nm), medium (23.0 nm) and small LDL (18.7 nm); and four HDL subclasses, i.e. very large (14.3 nm), large (12.1 nm), medium (10.9 nm) and small HDL (8.7 nm). The following components of the lipoprotein particles were quantified: phospholipids (PL), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol, free cholesterol (FC) and cholesterol esters (CE). 

## Statistical analysis

Because this study contains three ethnic groups from two different cohort studies with different time of sampling and measurement, we cannot directly compare metabolite variables between ethnic groups. As an alternative, we performed association analyses between HbA1c and circulating metabolites within each ethnic group. The outcome variable (y) was concentration of a metabolite, such as amino acids, ketone bodies, or lipoprotein particles. The predictor variable (x) was the HbA1c level. To assess the strength of associations between HbA1c and metabolites, we ran lognormal regression because the outcome variables are positive continuous data with skewed distributions. To study the dependency of ethnicity on the relationship between HbA1c and metabolic variables, we introduced ethnicity-specific intercepts and slopes into the model. We also adjusted for covariates including gender and age. We centered and scaled HbA1c and age by subtracting their mean values and dividing by their standard deviations. After scaling, one unit HbA1c means 10 mmol/mol and one unit age means 10 (years). Due to missing observations in both outcome and predictor variables, we applied a Bayesian lognormal regression to handle the missing data. There are two types of missing values: 1) when the concentration of a metabolite is below the limit of detection, or 2) when values were rejected by the automatic sample and measurement quality control procedure in the Nightingale pipeline. All the missing observations were assumed missing at random and treated as parameters. Values were randomly drawn from a normal distribution with ethnicity-dependent mean and standard deviation. Based on a previous study [@Dekker2015] the mean value and standard deviation of HbA1c is about 40 mmol/mol and 5 mmol/mol, therefore, we used $exponential(0.025)$ and $exponential(0.2)$ as prior distributions. Regarding the missing values that were below the limit of detection, the imputed values were constrained between zero and the minimal observed value. For the rest parameters, we used default prior distributions and fitted the model by running Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo in the program Stan (version 2.18.0) [@JSSv076i01]. We ran four Markov chains with 4000 iterations in each chain. Results were presented with the posterior mean of lognormal regression coefficient with 95% credible interval (CI). The regression coefficient represents the expected difference in log(metabolite concentration) due to a difference of one unit HbA1c.

# Result

## Participant characteristics

This study included in total 773 subjects from three ethnic groups in the Dutch population. Specifically, the study population consisted of 301 European Dutch, 255 Dutch with Ghanaian background, and 217 Dutch with African Surinamese background (Table 1). Dutch with European background were older than the other two ethnic groups. There were relatively more male participants in the Dutch with European background, and in the Dutch with African Surinamese background, there were relatively more female participants. To control for these possible confounding factors, all the results shown below were after adjusting for gender and age.

## Association of HbA1c with circulating amino acids

Since circulating amino acids are robust markers of T2DM, we first evaluated their associations with HbA1c in Dutch with European, Ghanaian and African Surinamese background. We observed that in Dutch with European background increasing HbA1c concentrations were associated with increasing concentrations of circulating isoleucine (regression coefficient in males 0.14 with 95% credible interval [0.10 0.18], in females 0.15 [0.10 0.19]), leucine (males 0.07 [0.04 0.10], females 0.07 [0.04 0.10]), valine (males 0.06 [0.03 0.09], females 0.07 [0.04 0.10]) and alanine (males 0.07 [0.04 0.11], females 0.08 [0.05 0.12]), as well as decreasing levels of glutamine (males -0.07 [-0.10 -0.03], females -0.08 [-0.12 -0.04]) (Fig. 1).

In Dutch with Ghanaian background, we observed that increasing HbA1c concentrations were associated with increasing concentrations of circulating isoleucine (females 0.03 [0.01 0.06]), and valine (females 0.03 [0.01 0.04]), as well as decreasing levels of glutamine (females -0.04 [-0.06 -0.01]) (Fig. 1).

In Dutch with African Surinamese background, we observed that increasing HbA1c concentrations were associated with increasing concentrations of circulating isoleucine (males 0.03 [0.003 0.06], females 0.04 [0.02 0.06]), leucine (males 0.02 [0.01 0.04], females 0.03 [0.01 0.04]), and valine (males 0.03 [0.02 0.05]), female 0.08 [0.05 0.12]), as well as decreasing levels of glutamine (males -0.02 [-0.05 -0.003], females -0.04 [-0.06 -0.02]) (Fig. 1).

## Association of HbA1c with circulating ketone bodies

In the next step, we assessed the association between HbA1c and ketone bodies. We observed that increasing levels of HbA1c were associated with decreasing levels of acetoacetate in subjects with European background (males -0.11 [-0.21 -0.01], females -0.15 [-0.25 -0.05]). However, increasing levels of HbA1c were associated with increasing levels of acetoacetate in subjects with Ghanaian (males 0.08 [0.02 0.15]) and African Surinamese (males 0.09 [0.02 0.15]) background (Fig. 2). 

## Association of HbA1c with circulating HDL particles

In subjects with European background, we observed that increasing levels of HbA1c were associated with decreasing concentrations of large (males -0.18 [-0.25 -0.12], females -0.16 [-0.23 -0.09]) and medium (males -0.04 [-0.07 -0.01], females -0.04 [-0.07 -0.01]) HDL particles (Fig. 3). 

In subjects with African Surinamese background, however, we observed that increasing levels of HbA1c were associated with increasing concentration of small HDL particle (males 0.01 [0.0004 0.02], females 0.01 [0.004 0.02]) (Fig. 3). 

# Discussion

"Why do subjects with African background have excess burden of T2DM?" To answer this question, we performed metabolite profiling in plasma of 773 subjects  from three ethnic groups in the Dutch population (Dutch with European, Ghanaian and African Surinamese background). Consistent with a recent meta-analysis [@Guasch-Ferre:2016aa], we observed that increasing levels of BCAAs, as well as decreasing levels of glutamine were associated with worsening of glycemia in Dutch with European background. We observed similar associations of HbA1c with circulating amino acids in subjects with Ghanaian and African Surinamese background. These observations suggested that amino acid metabolism was similar in subjects with European and African background. However, we observed that increasing levels of HbA1c were associated with increasing levels of acetoacetate in Dutch with Ghanaian and African Surinamese background, but associated with decreasing levels of acetoacetate in Dutch with European background. In liver, acetoacetate can be produced from tyrosine [@KNOX:1951aa]. Tyrosine was repeatedly identified to be associated with glycemia and insulin resistance in the general population [@Wurtz:2012aa; @Wurtz:2012ab; @Wurtz:2013aa; @Hellmuth:2016aa]. In South Asian men, tyrosine was identified as a strong predictor of T2DM incidence [@Tillin:2015aa]. Interestingly, we observed a high probability (93% in male and 94% in female) of positive association between HbA1c and tyrosine in Dutch with European background. In contrast, we observed a high probability (95% in male and 92% in female) of negative association between HbA1c and tyrosine in Dutch with Ghanaian background. In Dutch with African Surinamese background, we also observed a high probability (95% in male and 96% in female) of negative association between HbA1c and tyrosine. Acetoacetate was shown to strongly inhibit expression of ABCA1, a key player mediating cellular cholesterol efflux [@KNOX:1951aa; @Uehara:2002aa; @Phillips:2014aa]. Inactivation of ABCA1 leads to cholesterol accumulation in the pancreatic $\beta$ cells and impaired glucose tolerance [@Brunham:2007aa; @Vergeer:2010aa; @Kruit:2011aa]. The main acceptors of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux are small HDL particles [@Du:2015aa]. Interestingly, we observed that increasing concentrations of small HDL particles tended to associate with worsening of glycemia in subjects with African Surinamese background. Taking all these considerations together, we speculate that the excess burden of T2DM in subjects with African Surinamese and Ghanaian background might be due to impaired cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL caused by acetoacetate-induced inhibition of ABCA1 gene expression. Future research is needed to test our hypothesis.

One limitation of this study is that the three ethnic groups were from two different cohort studies, with different time of sampling and measurement. As a consequence, we cannot directly compare metabolite variables between ethnic groups but did run association analyses within each ethnic group. 

In conclusion, subjects with Ghanaian and African Surinamese background showed reversed associations of HbA1c with circulating acetoacetate, compared to Dutch with European background. We hypothesized that acetoacetate-induced inhibition of ABCA1 gene expression may link to impaired cholesterol efflux capacity to HDL in the ethnic groups of African background.
